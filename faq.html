      <li class="grid__item one-half">
        <h4 class="">How does the process work of selling my house?</h4>
        <p class="">Once we have some basic information on your property, a member of our team will contact you shortly with a cash offer (usually within 24 hours). In some situations, we will need to gather additional information about the condition of the home. Once complete, we will discuss all the details with you and make an offer the same day. If you accept, we will handle everything else, navigating the closing process from start to finish.</p>
      </li>
    
      <li class="grid__item one-half">
        <h4 class="">What sort of houses do you buy?</h4>
        <p class="">We buy houses in any condition, in any area, in any price range, in any situation! We will buy your house as-is - you don’t need to do any repairs!  We love to revitalize communities customize properties from the ground up so condition does not matter to us.</p>
      </li>
    
      <li class="grid__item one-half">
