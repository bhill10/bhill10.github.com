Unfortunately, this is one of life’s curveballs thrown at thousands of people every month. That’s why I want to arm you with the knowledge to make the best decisions possible concerning your property. Once you know all of your options, you can confidently make wise choices that will impact the rest of your life. Our goal is to put power back in your hands. When faced with a pending foreclosure, the best advice I can give you is to ACT NOW AND DON’T HESITATE.</p><li><span class="disclosure">+</span>Out of state owner</li><p class="hide">Do not go another day worrying about a house you don’t live in. There are many reasons why a house will often sit vacant. It may or may not be by choice, but it is almost always a problem for the owner. Unoccupied houses have a tendency to draw unnecessary attention to themselves. Many times it's the unwanted attention from neighborhood kids or others who see it as an opportunity to break out windows or vandalize the house. During the winter months, you pay for the utilities that are to be left on to keep the house in good condition: otherdwise, you shut them off and hope no damage will occur. Furthermore, unless you change your homeowner's policy, you may no longer be covered by insurance if your home is damaged after being unoccupied over 30 days.</p><li><span class="disclosure">+</span>Little or no equity</li><p class="hide">The "low equity, no equity" situation is the most common problem we come across. We purchase homes from people in situations like this all the time. In most cases we are able to return some of that hard earned equity to the homeowner, or at least reduce the amount of money they have to pull out-of-pocket at closing.</p><li><span class="disclosure">+</span>Divorce</li><p class="hide">No one plans to divorce, at least not at first, but many times situations change in such a way that two people may find that their lives and the house they own together have become a problem for them. Divorce is unpleasant enough without the burden of selling a house, especially when it prevents you from going your separate ways. We deal with divorce situations on a regular basis and we can help you quickly sell your house so you can get on with your life.</p><li><span class="disclosure">+</span>Damages and repairs</li><p class="hide">If you need to sell your house and it is in need of major repairs, chances are many people won't consider buying it. Most people can't or won't get a loan on a house that needs fixing up before they are able to move in. Most lending institutions won't loan money on properties that are in need of major repair since they make poor collateral. BB&B Investments can and will buy houses that need repairs. In fact, we buy distressed properties all the time and make the repairs ourselves. We can take an old, ugly, run-down house and make it look like brand new again. Not only do we help you by buying and repairing your house, we help others by providing them with a beautiful home while helping make their neighborhood a better place in which to live.</p><li><span class="disclosure">+</span>Relocation</li><p class="hide">A job transfer or relocation is usually a good thing and means that congratulations are in order. However, relocation can also be very stressful if you have a great new job, but have to worry about selling your house before you move. Often there isn't enough time to get your house sold before you move and you end up getting stuck making double payments on a house you no longer live in. The last thing you need to be worried about when taking a new position is selling your house. We can buy your home quickly, and allow you to get on with your life and new opportunities. We can take over your payments and maintenance of the property and allow you the freedom to move quickly if necessary. We will continue to handle the payments and maintenance until the house is sold and your mortgage is paid off in full.</p><li><span class="disclosure">+</span>Death of a loved one/Probate</li><p class="hide">We understand that losing a loved one can be a very difficult and stressful time. This can be compounded, when you have inherited property that you don’t know what to do with or cannot afford to maintain. Maybe you've inherited a property or have the responsibility to get rid of it on behalf of the estate. The death of a loved one is tragic enough, but the added burden of dealing with the estate can become almost unbearable. Whatever the case may be, the probate and selling process can often be confusing, costly and aggravating. Much of the estate may be easy to dispose of or distribute, but rarely is that the case with real estate holdings. Many times selling the real estate can take months... BB&B Investments wants to help. We can often speed up the selling process by giving you a fast, fair offer that is acceptable to all the heirs so you can settle the estate quickly and get on with your life!</p><li><span class="disclosure">+</span>Tax liens</li><p class="hide">Are you being hassled by unwanted creditors?

The effort put into marketing the house, negotiating difficult contracts with realtors, showing the house to unruly and unqualified buyers, keeping the house in order, and "waiting" to see if an offer is presented may add more stress. Especially if you consider the average number of days a property will sit on the market before it sells. Not to mention that the downturn in the market may mean your house will be worth a lot less six months from now. All that can lead to a very undesirable experience when it comes to selling your property</p><li><span class="disclosure">+</span>Tax liens</li><p class="hide">Are you being hassled by unwanted creditors?

Fortunately, you don't have to continue like this. We can take the problem property off your hands.
